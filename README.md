This is the lab submissions of ECSP303 (Machine Learning Lab). 

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. 

  It involves using algorithms to recognize patterns and improve performance over time.
  
The cost function measures the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs in a machine learning model, guiding the optimization process.

Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that minimizes the cost function by adjusting model parameters.
  It does this by calculating the gradient (slope) of the cost function and updating the parameters in the direction that reduces the cost, step by step, until it converges to a minimum value.
  
Linear Regression: Predicts a continuous target variable by fitting a linear relationship between input features and the target.

Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification, predicting a probability for each class.

Decision Trees: Uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences to make predictions.

A confusion matrix shows the accuracy of a classification model by comparing actual versus predicted results, displaying correct and incorrect predictions across categories.
